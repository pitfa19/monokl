"""fetch_many must apply the same SSRF gate as fetch().

It is the main fetch path (every wave-1 fetcher batch goes through it), so a
gate that only covered fetch() would leave the bulk of outbound traffic
unprotected. Offline: only .pdf URLs are used and _fetch_pdf is stubbed to
SUCCEED, so the browser lane is never touched — since v0.9.1 a *failed* PDF
falls back to the browser (that path is covered in test_fetch_many_fallback
and test_final_url_recheck).
