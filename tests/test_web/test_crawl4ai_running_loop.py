"""fetch() must work when called on a thread that already has a running event loop.

The MCP server's fastmcp tool dispatch calls synchronous tool functions directly on
its own running event-loop thread (it does not offload them to a worker thread), so
fetch_url's call chain into Crawl4AIProvider.fetch() lands there too. A plain
asyncio.run() inside fetch() would raise "cannot be called from a running event
loop" in that case; the CLI's plain synchronous invocation has no such loop and must
keep working exactly as before.
